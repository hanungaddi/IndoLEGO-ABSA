2.The	O

are	O
the	O

isnt	B-NEG
very	I-NEG

I	O
have	O

the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O

does	B-NEG
not	I-NEG
work	O
on	O
the	O
24	O
twenty	O
fourth	O

my	O

I	O
would	O

The	O
Windows	O

is	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O

a	O
great	B-POS
way	O

after	O
2	O

it	O
did	B-NEG

work	O

The	O
OS	O
is	O
still	O
as	O

as	O
the	O
day	O
that	O
the	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
wish	O
this	O
had	O
was	O
the	O
option	O
to	O
turn	B-NEG
off	I-NEG
the	O

a	O

my	O

I	O
especially	O
like	B-POS
the	O

The	O
buttons	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
press	O
a	O
little	O
harder	B-NEG

most	O

But	O
to	O
be	O
honest	O
,	O
I	O
do	B-NEU

use	I-NEU
my	O
computer	O
for	O
anything	O
like	O

complex	O

The	O
one	O

I	O

it	O
had	O
was	O
a	O
detailed	B-NEG

the	O

However	O

My	O

for	O

a	O
very	O
expensive	O

not	B-NEG

the	O

the	O

if	O

something	O
