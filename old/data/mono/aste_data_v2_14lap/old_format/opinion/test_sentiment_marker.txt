I	O
wanted	O
a	O

that	O

is	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

I	O
like	B-POS
the	O

I	O
only	O
wish	B-NEU
this	O
mac	O
had	O
a	O
CD/DVD	O

built	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
miss	B-NEG
is	O
that	O
my	O
old	O
Alienware	O
laptop	O
had	O
backlit	O
keys	O
.	O

So	O
happy	O
with	O
this	O
purchase	O
,	O
I	O
just	O
wish	B-NEU
it	O
came	O
with	O
Microsoft	O
Word	O
.	O

It	O
has	O
enough	B-POS
memory	O
and	O
speed	O
to	O
run	O
my	O
business	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
flexibility	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
a	O
laptop	O
.	O

The	O
battery	O
life	O
is	O
excellent	B-POS
,	O
the	O
display	O
is	O
excellent	B-POS
,	O
and	O
downloading	O
apps	O
is	O
a	O
breeze	B-POS
.	O

The	O
screen	O
,	O
the	O
software	O
and	O
the	O
smoothness	B-POS
of	O
the	O
operating	O
system	O
.	O

But	O
with	O
this	O
laptop	O
,	O
the	O
bass	O
is	O
very	O
weak	B-NEG
and	O
the	O
sound	O
comes	O
out	O
sounding	O
tinny	B-NEG
.	O

The	O
built	O
quality	O
is	O
really	O
good	B-POS
,	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
Happy	B-POS
and	O
excited	B-POS
about	O
this	O
Product	O

I	O
am	O
loving	B-POS
the	O
fast	B-POS
performance	O

Further	O
,	O
this	O
Mac	O
Mini	O
has	O
a	O
sloppy	B-NEG
Bluetooth	O
interface	O
(	O
courtesy	B-NEG
of	O
the	O
Mac	O
OS	O
)	O
and	O
the	O
range	O
is	O
poor	B-NEG

My	O
only	O
gripe	B-NEG
would	O
be	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
add	O
more	O
RAM	O

Fine	B-NEU

A	O
veryimportant	B-POS
feature	O
is	O
Firewire	O

which	O
in	O
my	O
experience	O
works	O
better	B-POS
then	O
USB3	O
(	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
originally	O
sold	O
on	O
the	O
MAC	O

I	O
felt	O
it	O
was	O
inferior	B-NEG
in	O
many	O
ways	O
To	O
