A	O
month	O

the	O
freaking	B-NEG

just	O
died	B-NEG

The	O
system	O
it	O
comes	O
with	O

not	B-NEG
work	I-NEG
properly	I-NEG

so	O
when	O

it	O
it	O
started	O

at	O

Then	O
after	O
4	O
or	O
so	O
months	O
the	O

stopped	B-NEG

I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
go	O
out	O

buy	O

to	O

its	O

I	O
also	O
enjoy	B-NEU
the	O
fact	O
that	O
my	O
MacBook	O

allows	O
me	O
to	O
run	O
Windows	O

the	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
purchase	O
the	O

they	O
refused	B-NEU

because	O
they	O
knew	O
it	O

We	O
upgraded	O

The	O
reality	O
was	O

it	O
heated	O
up	O
very	O
quickly	O

and	O
took	O
way	O
too	O
long	B-NEG

do	O
simple	O

opening	O
my	O

I	O
had	O
always	O
used	O

been	O
constantly	O

the	O

the	O
poorly	B-NEG
designed	I-NEG
operating	O

that	O
were	O
never	O
very	O
intuitive	B-NEG

Then	O
,	O
within	O
5	O

the	O

crapped	B-NEG
out	O
on	O

if	O
you	O

you	O

I	O

I	O
continued	O

they	O
replaced	B-NEG
the	O

Then	O

to	O
the	O

by	O
the	O

The	O

I	O
would	O
recommend	B-POS
it	O
just	O
because	O
of	O
the	O

thats	O
the	O

thing	O
i	O
really	O
care	O
about	O

The	O
screen	O
shows	O
great	B-POS

Reason	O
why	O
?	O
It	O
's	O
because	O
when	O
you	O

it	O

you	O
know	O
first	O
thing	O
that	O
you	O
will	O
not	O

even	O
if	O
Apple	O

to	O
change	O

,	O
your	O

value	O
will	O
only	O
drop	B-POS
10-20	O
%	O

more	O

80	O

The	O
17	O

very	O
large	B-NEG

but	O
the	O

very	O

My	O
opinion	O
of	O
Sony	O
has	O
been	O
dropping	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
the	O
stock	O
market	O
,	O
given	O
their	O
horrible	B-NEG

but	O
this	O

just	O
caused	O
another	O
plunge	O

For	O
the	O

you	O

it	O

I	O
also	O
liked	B-POS
the	O

The	O

is	O
pretty	O
sweet	B-POS
when	O
you	O

The	O

has	O
not	O
decreased	B-POS
since	O
I	O

i	O

thrilled	O

that	O

When	O
I	O
called	O
Toshiba	O

they	O

even	O
though	O
they	O
did	B-NEG

I	O
bought	O
this	O

Oh	O
and	O
if	O
thats	O
not	O
bad	B-NEG
enough	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
come	O
with	O

I	O

never	O

I	O

about	O

I	O
thought	O
I	O
was	O

The	O

The	O

thing	O
I	O

that	O
the	O

the	O

keep	I-NEG

The	O

My	O
one	O

that	O
I	O

it	O

that	O
the	O

work	I-NEG

it	O

all	O

I	O

not	O

on	O
the	O

enough	B-POS

acually	O

the	O

with	O
the	O
Nvidia	O

the	O

the	O
only	O
reason	O
they	O

is	O
