The	O

but	O
they	O
REALLY	O
need	O
to	O
clean	O
that	O
vent	B-CONCEPT
in	O
the	O

its	O
quite	O
un-appetizing	O

kills	O
your	O

to	O
make	O
this	O

modern	O

Their	O

$	O

and	O
there	O
is	O
much	O
tasty	O
food	B-CONCEPT
,	O
all	O
of	O
it	O
fresh	O
and	O
continually	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
vegetarian	O
but	O
,	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
dishes	B-CONCEPT
were	O
great	O
.	O

The	O
food	B-CONCEPT
here	O
is	O
rather	O
good	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
it	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
somosas	B-CONCEPT
,	O
chai	B-CONCEPT
,	O
and	O
the	O
chole	B-CONCEPT
,	O
but	O
the	O
dhosas	B-CONCEPT
and	O
dhal	B-CONCEPT
were	O
kinda	O
disappointing	O
.	O

The	O
service	B-CONCEPT
varys	O
from	O
day	O
to	O
day-	O
sometimes	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
nice	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
not	O
.	O

Also	O
,	O
specify	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
your	O
food	B-CONCEPT
spicy-	O
its	O
rather	O
bland	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O

The	O
ambience	B-CONCEPT
is	O
pretty	O
and	O
nice	O
for	O
conversation	O
,	O
so	O
a	O
casual	O
lunch	O
here	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
best	O
.	O

The	O
lava	B-CONCEPT
cake	I-CONCEPT
dessert	I-CONCEPT
was	O
incredible	O
and	O
I	O
recommend	O
it	O

Once	O
you	O

into	O
Cosette	B-CONCEPT

you	O
're	O
miraculously	O
in	O
a	O
small	O

off-the-beaten	O

This	O

is	O
as	O

as	O
it	O
gets	O
,	O
with	O
that	O
certain	O

The	O

The	O

The	O

I	O
