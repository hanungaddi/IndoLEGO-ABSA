Saul	O

the	O

The	O

I	O

the	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
incredible	B-POS

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
moderately	O
enjoyed	B-POS
was	O
their	O
Grilled	O

Edamame	O

I	O
had	O
never	O
had	O

I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
innovative	B-POS

tasty	B-POS
(	O
could	O
've	O
used	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O

The	O
decor	O
is	O
night	B-POS
tho	O
...	O
but	O
they	O
REALLY	O
need	O
to	O
clean	O
that	O
vent	O
in	O
the	O
ceiling	O
...	O
its	O
quite	O
un-appetizing	B-NEG
,	O
and	O
kills	O
your	O
effort	O
to	O
make	O
this	O
place	O
look	O
sleek	B-NEG
and	O
modern	B-NEG
.	O

Their	O
sake	O
list	O

we	O

The	O

the	O

This	O

to	O
be	O
the	O
best	B-POS
japanese	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O
new	O

Food	O
is	O

Service	O

The	O

We	O
took	O
advanatage	O
of	O
the	O
half	O

on	O
saturday	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
worth	B-POS
it	O
.	O

$	O
6	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
much	O
tasty	B-POS
food	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
it	O
fresh	B-POS
and	O
continually	O
refilled	B-POS

I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
vegetarian	O
but	O
,	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
dishes	O
were	O
great	B-POS
.	O

The	O
food	O
here	O
is	O
rather	O
good	B-POS
,	O
but	O
only	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
it	O

I	O
like	B-POS
the	O
somosas	O
,	O
chai	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
chole	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
dhosas	O
and	O
dhal	O
were	O
kinda	O
disappointing	B-NEG
.	O

The	O
service	O
varys	B-NEG
from	O
day	O
to	O
day-	O
sometimes	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
nice	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
not	O
.	O

Also	O
,	O
specify	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
your	O
food	O
spicy-	O
its	O
rather	O
bland	B-NEG
if	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O

The	O
ambience	O
is	O
pretty	B-POS
and	O
nice	B-POS
for	O
conversation	O
,	O
so	O
a	O
casual	O
lunch	O
here	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
best	O
.	O

The	O
lava	O
cake	O
dessert	O
was	O
incredible	B-POS
and	O
I	O
recommend	B-POS
it	O

Once	O
you	O
step	O
into	O
Cosette	O

you	O
're	O
miraculously	O
in	O
a	O
small	O

off-the-beaten	B-POS
path	O
Parisian	O

This	O

is	O
as	O
cozy	B-POS
as	O
it	O
gets	O
,	O
with	O
that	O
certain	O
Parisian	O

The	O

was	O
average	B-POS

above-average	I-POS
;	O
the	O
French	O
Onion	O

yet	O
not	B-POS

and	O
the	O

in	O
any	O

The	O
pizza	O
is	O
overpriced	B-NEG

soggy	B-NEG

I	O
think	O
I	O
've	O
had	O
some	O
the	O
best	B-POS

of	O
my	O

and	O
the	O
ever-changing	B-POS

some	O
great	B-POS

The	O

super-fresh	B-POS

in	O
the	O

are	O
unusual	O

really	O
delicious	B-POS

As	O

I	O
've	O
lived	O
in	O
the	O

The	O
