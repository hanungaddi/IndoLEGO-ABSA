At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .####[([5], 'service general', 'NEG')]
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .####[([18], 'food quality', 'NEG')]
I couldn ' t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .####[([-1], 'food style_options', 'NEG')]
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .####[([-1], 'food quality', 'NEG')]
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , " oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier " No apology , nothing .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]

Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]

There ' s another girl who I can ' t describe , she is about 5 ' 6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you ' re *really * talking about .####[([4], 'service general', 'NEG')]
