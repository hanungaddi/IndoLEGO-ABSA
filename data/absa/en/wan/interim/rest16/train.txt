Just want to warn you all - don ' t waste your time and money .####[([-1], 'restaurant general', 'NEG')]
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional . . .####[([5], 'ambience general', 'NEG'), ([11, 12], 'ambience general', 'NEG')]

The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I don ' t like being cramp in a corner .####[([1], 'food quality', 'POS'), ([9, 10], 'ambience general', 'NEG')]
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .####[([8], 'restaurant general', 'POS'), ([8], 'ambience general', 'POS')]

A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it .####[([5], 'restaurant general', 'POS')]
The atmosphere was great .####[([1], 'ambience general', 'POS')]
The food we ordered was excellent , although I wouldn ' t say the margaritas were anything to write home about .####[([1], 'food quality', 'POS'), ([14], 'drinks quality', 'NEU')]
Our waitress wasn ' t mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####[([1], 'service general', 'NEU')]
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####[([12], 'restaurant general', 'POS')]

The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####[([1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
Polite acknowledgement is out ;####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
supercilious scorn is in .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####[([2], 'service general', 'NEG'), ([17], 'food quality', 'POS')]
Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn ' t sat cooling in front of the guest .####[([2], 'food quality', 'POS'), ([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
The place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins )####[([5, 6, 7], 'ambience general', 'POS'), ([11], 'ambience general', 'POS'), ([22, 23], 'drinks style_options', 'POS'), ([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
At $120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you ' re looking to pay by the hour for passive - aggressive torture .####[([-1], 'restaurant prices', 'NEG'), ([-1], 'restaurant general', 'NEG'), ([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
On that scale , it ' s a world - beater .####[([-1], 'restaurant general', 'NEG')]

Everything was going good until we got our meals .####[([-1], 'restaurant general', 'POS'), ([8], 'food quality', 'NEG')]
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .####[([6], 'food style_options', 'NEG')]
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .####[([-1], 'food style_options', 'NEG'), ([12], 'food quality', 'NEG')]
I took one bite from the $24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .####[([7], 'food quality', 'NEG'), ([7], 'food prices', 'NEG')]
At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .####[([5], 'service general', 'NEG')]
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .####[([18], 'food quality', 'NEG')]
I couldn ' t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .####[([-1], 'food style_options', 'NEG')]
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .####[([-1], 'food quality', 'NEG')]
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , " oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier " No apology , nothing .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it ' s a matter of taste that she didn ' t like it , and I cannot comp it .####[([10], 'service general', 'NEG')]
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
The level of rudeness was preposterous .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .####[([1], 'service general', 'NEG'), ([25], 'drinks quality', 'POS'), ([27], 'food quality', 'POS')]

The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .####[([-1], 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'NEG')]

Only complaint is the pricing - - I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####[([25], 'food prices', 'NEG')]

Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don ' t put you off –####[([1], 'food quality', 'POS'), ([5, 6, 7, 8], 'service general', 'NEG')]
It ' s a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we ' ve eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .####[([-1], 'restaurant prices', 'NEG')]
Each time we ' ve been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they ' re fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .####[([15], 'service general', 'POS'), ([8, 9, 10, 11], 'service general', 'NEG'), ([44, 45], 'food quality', 'POS')]
As BFC doesn ' t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####[([1], 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'NEG'), ([22, 23, 24, 25], 'service general', 'NEG'), ([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
The frizzy retro girl ( with winged / Dame Edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .####[([3], 'service general', 'NEG')]
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she " had a BBQ to go to " that night - WTF ? ?####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
I ' d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####[([7], 'service general', 'NEG')]
There ' s another girl who I can ' t describe , she is about 5 ' 6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you ' re *really * talking about .####[([4], 'service general', 'NEG')]
I ' m a friendly person , so I wouldn ' t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
Again , I ' d be super upset if that were my employee .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head , I expect better service .####[([13], 'service general', 'NEG'), ([-1], 'restaurant prices', 'NEG')]

His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
A word to the wise : you can ' t dine here and disturb the maitre - D ' s sense of " table turnover " , as whacked as it is , or else .####[([15, 16, 17], 'service general', 'NEG')]

Taking Hot Dogs to the next level####[([1, 2], 'food quality', 'POS')]
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you don ' t just get your average hot dog .####[([17], 'restaurant prices', 'NEG'), ([11, 12], 'food quality', 'POS')]

On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]

I can ' t believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it ) .####[([1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
I couldn ' t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
