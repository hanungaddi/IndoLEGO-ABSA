I	O

their	O

I	O
had	O
never	O
had	O

I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
innovative	B-POS

(	O
could	O
've	O
used	O
a	O

Their	O

we	O

it	O

the	O
best	B-POS
japanese	O

We	O
took	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
well	O

it	O

In	O
the	O

,	O
this	O

attracted	B-POS
a	O

there	O

all	O

continually	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
vegetarian	O
but	O
,	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
dishes	O
were	O
great	B-POS

The	O
food	O
here	O
is	O
rather	O
good	B-POS
,	O
but	O
only	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
it	O

I	O
like	B-POS
the	O
somosas	O

the	O
chole	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
dhosas	O

dhal	O
were	O
kinda	O
disappointing	B-NEG

The	O
service	O
varys	B-NEG
from	O
day	O
to	O
day-	O
sometimes	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
nice	O

and	O
sometimes	O
not	O

Also	O
,	O
specify	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
your	O
food	O
spicy-	O
its	O
rather	O
bland	B-NEG
if	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
.	O

The	O
ambience	O
is	O
pretty	B-POS
and	O
nice	B-POS
for	O
conversation	O
,	O
so	O
a	O
casual	O

here	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O

The	O
lava	O

I	O

Once	O

The	O

the	O

The	O

Yes	O

they	O

The	O
