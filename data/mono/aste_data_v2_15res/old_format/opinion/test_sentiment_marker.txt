better	I-NEG
service	O
.	O

The	O
food	O
and	O
service	O
were	O
fine	B-POS
,	O
however	O
the	O
maitre-D	O
was	O
incredibly	O
unwelcoming	B-NEG
and	O
arrogant	B-NEG

While	O
finishing	O
our	O
meals	O
which	O
included	O
a	O

This	O

she	O
left	O

followed	O
shortly	O
by	O
the	O
four	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
before	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
in	O
my	O
40	O
years	O
of	O
world	O
travel	O
,	O
including	O
Paris	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
such	O
a	O
display	O
of	O
bad	B-NEG
behavior	O
by	O
a	O
frontman	O
in	O
a	O

Best	B-POS

the	O

which	O
was	O
very	O
good	B-POS
,	O
and	O
my	O
mother	O
had	O
the	O
swordfish	O

The	O
Four	O
Seasons	O
restaurant	O
is	O
a	O
great	B-POS
experience	O
.	O

The	O
food	O
is	O
great	B-POS
and	O
the	O
environment	O
is	O
even	O
better	B-POS

Here	O
the	O
hot	O
dog	O
is	O
elevated	B-POS
to	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
a	O
real	O
entree	O
with	O
numerous	O

everything	O

Cool	B-POS

in	O
the	O
back	O
really	O
ads	O
to	O
it	O
but	O
needs	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
heat	O
throughout	O
on	O
a	O
cold	O
night	O

Poor	B-NEG
service	O
and	O
management	O

Had	O
an	O
awful	B-NEG
experience	O
at	O
Casa	O
la	O
Femme	O
on	O
a	O
Saturday	O
dinner	O
.	O

The	O
manager	O
was	O
rude	B-NEG
and	O
handled	O
the	O
situation	O
extremely	O
poorly	O

Can	O
â€™	O
t	O
believe	O
how	O
an	O
expensive	B-NEG
NYC	O
restaurant	O
can	O
be	O
so	O
disrespectful	O
to	O
its	O
clients	O

The	O
food	O
is	O
very	O
good	B-NEU
,	O
but	O
not	B-NEU
outstanding	I-NEU

The	O
bread	O
was	O
stale	B-NEG
,	O
the	O
salad	O
was	O
overpriced	B-NEG
and	O
empty	B-NEG

The	O
pasta	O
was	O
well	B-NEG
cooked	I-NEG
,	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
enough	O
sauce	O
though	O
or	O
flavor	O
.	O

The	O
hostess	O
was	O
rude	B-NEG
and	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
distinct	O
feeling	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
serve	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
my	O
friend	O
left	O
out	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
the	O
bartender	O
disappeared	B-NEG

Shame	O
on	O
this	O

for	O
the	O
horrible	O
rude	B-NEG
staff	O
and	O
non-existent	B-NEG
customer	O

I	O
