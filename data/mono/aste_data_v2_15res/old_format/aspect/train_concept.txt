I	O

so	O
it	O

In	O
the	O

this	O

attracted	O
a	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
vegetarian	O
but	O
,	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
dishes	B-CONCEPT
were	O
great	O
.	O

The	O
food	B-CONCEPT
here	O
is	O
rather	O
good	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
to	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
somosas	B-CONCEPT

the	O
chole	B-CONCEPT
,	O
but	O
the	O
dhosas	B-CONCEPT
and	O
dhal	B-CONCEPT
were	O
kinda	O
disappointing	O

The	O
service	B-CONCEPT
varys	O
from	O
day	O
to	O
day-	O
sometimes	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
nice	O

like	O
your	O
food	B-CONCEPT
spicy-	O
its	O
rather	O
bland	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
.	O

The	O
ambience	B-CONCEPT
is	O
pretty	O
and	O
nice	O
for	O

so	O
a	O

lunch	O
here	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O

The	O

with	O

The	O
